Objective!
The goal is to create a dynamic and user-friendly game database application where users can search for games, view a list of all available games, and access detailed information about each game. Users should be able to browse the database easily, filter games by various parameters, and get more information with a single click.


User Stories
1. Game List
As a user,
I want to view a list of all games in the database,
So that I can browse through different games and choose the one I want to explore further.

2. Game Search
As a user,
I want to search for games by title, genre, or release year,
So that I can quickly find a specific game from the database.

3. Game Details
As a user,
I want to see detailed information about a selected game,
So that I can learn more about its plot, gameplay, system requirements, reviews, and ratings.

Functional Requirements:
Game List:

Display all games in a structured list.
Each game should show essential information like title, genre, release date, and thumbnail image.


Notes
Database: The database should include tables or collections for storing game metadata such as title, genre, release date, platform, system requirements, and user ratings.
Search Functionality: Implement efficient search algorithms, possibly leveraging full-text search or filters to quickly narrow down search results.
Game Detail: Each game entry should include both structured data (e.g., genres, platforms) and unstructured data (e.g., description, reviews).



Future Planning
